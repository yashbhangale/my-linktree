#  Linktree Alternative
This is a Linktree alternative built with Vite and Svelte that can also be used as a personal portfolio. It includes some references from W3Schools for styling and formatting.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, you can use either Yarn or npm to install the required packages:

```
yarn install
```
or

```
npm install
```
Once the packages are installed, you can start the development server using:

```
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server on http://localhost:3000. You can then view the project in your browser.

To build the project for deployment, use:

```
npm run build
```
This will create an optimized production build in the dist directory.

ustomize the colors and styles of the link tree by modifying the src/styles/theme.css and src/styles/global.css files.

## Credits
The styling and formatting of this link tree were inspired by W3Schools. Some of the icons used in this project were adapted from the Feather Icons library.
